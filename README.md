## What is Wordle?
**Wordle** is a puzzle game where you try to guess a random 5 letters word to find the correct one. It challenges you to find it in six attempts, the letters are highlighted with 3 different colors each color indicates the letter relationship with the correct word. 
* **Green**: The letter is correct and in the right position.
* **Yellow**: The letter is correct but in the wrong position.
* **Gray**: The letter is incorrect.

It was first developed by `Josh Wardle` in 2021.
## Why did I create wordle project?

This game blew up in popularity in the last couple of years and became main stream. Me and my friends found out about it and we were doing it together most of the days when we gather up in an onine chat. Moreover, since it was very popular people came up with different varations of the game such as an arabic version for arabic words and some game versions like pokedle where you try and guess the pokemon based on their features instead of words, we also played them for the fun of it. Thus, I thought it would be a great idea to develope the game myslef and let my friends try it out.
